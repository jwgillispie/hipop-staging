# Vendor-Market Relationship & Freemium Model Planning

## Overview
This document outlines the planned features for vendor-market relationships, freemium pricing tiers, and verification systems for the hipop platform.

## 1. Vendor-Market Relationship User Stories (Updated)

### 1.1 Vendor Permission Request (Primary Flow)
**Flow**: Vendor ‚Üí Market Organizer (Permission-based)
- Vendor submits permission request to join a specific market
- Request includes vendor profile data and intended posting plans
- Market organizer reviews request in applications dashboard
- If approved: vendor is automatically added to market with full profile info
- Vendor can then create pop-ups associated with that market
- **Implementation needs**: Permission request system, approval workflow, profile data transfer

### 1.2 Central Pop-up Creation Screen
**Flow**: Enhanced vendor pop-up creation
- **Vendor Dashboard**: Single "Create Pop-up" action card leads to unified creation screen
- **Creation Screen**: Toggle between Independent vs Market-Associated pop-ups
- **Independent Pop-up**: Vendor creates standalone event (no market association)
- **Market-Associated Pop-up**: Vendor selects from markets they've been approved for
- **Implementation needs**: Dedicated creation screen with unified UI, approved markets filtering

### 1.3 Market Creates Vendor Profile (Email Invitation)
**Flow**: Market ‚Üí Vendor (Email invitation)
- Market admin adds vendor by email address
- System sends invitation email to vendor
- Email contains account creation link with pre-populated email
- Vendor completes account setup
- Market-provided vendor data is automatically populated
- **Implementation needs**: Email invitation system, account creation flow, data pre-population

### 1.4 Shopper Search by Date & Favorites
**Flow**: Shopper experience enhancement
- Shoppers can filter markets/events by specific dates
- Shoppers can favorite markets that operate on preferred days
- **Implementation needs**: Date filtering, favorites system, user preferences

## Clarified Workflow Details

### Vendor Permission Request vs Application
**Key Distinction**: Instead of "applying to participate in a market event," vendors now "request permission to join a market" which allows them to create pop-ups for that market ongoing.

**Process**:
1. Vendor browses all available markets
2. Vendor submits permission request with profile info
3. Market organizer reviews in applications dashboard (reusing existing UI)
4. If approved: vendor gains ongoing permission to create pop-ups for that market
5. Vendor uses central pop-up widget, selecting from approved markets

### Pop-up Creation Flow
1. **Dashboard Action**: Single "Create Pop-up" card on vendor dashboard
2. **Central Screen**: Dedicated screen with Independent vs Market-Associated toggle
3. **Market Selection**: If market-associated, show only approved markets
4. **Creation**: Standard pop-up creation flow with market context

### Vendor Dashboard Quick Actions
1. **Create Pop-up**: Leads to unified creation screen
2. **My Applications**: View application status
3. **Market Invitations**: Manage market permission requests
4. **Profile**: Edit vendor profile
5. **Calendar**: View pop-up events calendar
6. **Analytics**: Performance metrics (coming soon)
