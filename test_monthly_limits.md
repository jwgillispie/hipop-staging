# Post Limit Enforcement Test Plan

## Issue Fixed
- **Problem**: Free vendors could create unlimited market posts (4th post created without restriction)
- **Root Cause**: Monthly post count tracking was hardcoded to `currentUsage = 0` 
- **Solution**: Implemented proper monthly count checking from `vendor_stats` collection

## Implementation Details

### Changes Made:

1. **CreatePopUpScreen (`lib/features/shared/screens/create_popup_screen.dart`)**:
   - Added `_getCurrentMonthlyPostCount()` method to query actual usage from Firestore
   - Added `_checkMonthlyPostLimit()` method to validate limits before post creation
   - Added validation call in `_savePost()` method for ALL post types (not just market)
   - Fixed hardcoded `currentUsage = 0` to use real data
   - Updated visual indicators to show for all post types

2. **VendorPostsRepository (`lib/repositories/vendor_posts_repository.dart`)**:
   - Modified `createPost()` to track count immediately for ALL post types
   - Removed duplicate counting in `approvePost()` (since count happens on creation)
   - ALL posts (market and independent) are counted on creation

### Logic Flow:

```
User Creates ANY Post (Market or Independent) â†’ 
  Check if Premium (unlimited) â†’ 
  Check Monthly Count vs Limit (3 total) â†’ 
  If Exceeded: Show Error + Upgrade Prompt â†’ 
  If OK: Create Post + Increment Count â†’ 
  Market Posts: Organizer Approval â†’ Post Becomes Visible
  Independent Posts: Immediately Visible
```

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Free Vendor - First 3 Posts (Mix of Market & Independent)
- **Expected**: Posts 1, 2, 3 should create successfully (any combination of types)
- **Expected**: Count increments in `vendor_stats` collection for ALL posts
- **Expected**: Market posts show as pending in organizer workflow
- **Expected**: Independent posts immediately visible

### Scenario 2: Free Vendor - 4th Post (Limit Enforcement)
- **Expected**: 4th post creation should be blocked (regardless of type)
- **Expected**: Error message: "You've reached your monthly limit of 3 posts"
- **Expected**: Upgrade prompt shown with "Upgrade to Vendor Pro" option

### Scenario 3: Premium Vendor
- **Expected**: Unlimited posts allowed
- **Expected**: No count tracking for premium users

### Scenario 4: Monthly Reset
- **Expected**: Count resets automatically when month changes
- **Expected**: Previous month count ignored

## Current Status
âœ… **FIXED**: Monthly limit enforcement now properly implemented
âœ… **TESTED**: Code compiles without errors
ðŸ”„ **PENDING**: End-to-end flow testing with real user

## Notes
- Count tracking happens on **creation** for ALL post types, not approval
- Limit applies to TOTAL posts: market + independent = max 3 per month
- Premium status bypasses all counting
- Monthly reset is automatic based on `currentCountMonth` field
- Visual indicators show remaining count for all post creation screens
