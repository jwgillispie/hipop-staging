# HiPop Email Notification System

This document outlines the email notification system implemented for vendor-market relationships and application processes in the HiPop Flutter app.

## Overview

The email system provides automated notifications for key events in the vendor-market relationship lifecycle, improving communication and streamlining the application process.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Core Email Service

#### EmailService (`lib/features/shared/services/email_service.dart`)
- **Purpose**: Central service for handling email notifications across the app
- **Features**:
  - Vendor invitation emails when markets invite vendors to join
  - Support notifications for vendor applications
  - Market application notifications to organizers
  - Proper email content formatting with branding
  - Error handling and graceful fallbacks

### 2. Integration Points

#### Vendor Market Relationship Service
- **Enhanced with email functionality**: Automatically sends invitation emails when markets create vendor invitations
- **Application notifications**: Sends support notifications when vendors apply to join markets
- **Error handling**: Email failures don't block the core relationship operations

## Email Types

### 1. Vendor Invitations
**Triggered when**: Markets invite vendors to join via invitation token
**Recipients**: Invited vendor's email address
**Content includes**:
- Market information (name, location, description)
- Operating schedule details
- Personal message from market organizer (if provided)
- Invitation token for easy acceptance
- App download links and instructions
- HiPop branding and contact information

### 2. Support Notifications
**Triggered when**: Vendors submit applications to join markets
**Recipients**: hipopmarkets@gmail.com (support email)
**Content includes**:
- Vendor details (name, email)
- Market information
- Application type and metadata
- Timestamp for tracking

### 3. General Support Messages
**Triggered when**: Various support scenarios throughout the app
**Recipients**: hipopmarkets@gmail.com
**Content includes**:
- Subject and detailed message
- User email (if provided)
- Additional metadata for context
- Timestamp for tracking

## Technical Implementation

### Current Status: Development/Debug Mode
- **Email content logging**: All emails are currently logged to debug console
- **TODO markers**: Placeholders for actual email service integration (SendGrid, AWS SES, etc.)
- **Error handling**: Robust error handling ensures email failures don't break core functionality
- **Graceful fallbacks**: System continues to work even if email service is unavailable

### Integration with Core Services
- **VendorMarketRelationshipService**: Enhanced with email notifications
- **Support contact**: Uses hipopmarkets@gmail.com as configured contact email
- **Market information**: Pulls market details from MarketService
- **User profiles**: Integrates with UserProfileService for organizer information

## Configuration

### Email Settings
- **Support Email**: `hipopmarkets@gmail.com`
- **Branding**: Consistent HiPop branding across all email templates
- **App Links**: `https://hipopapp.com` for app downloads
- **Contact Information**: Support email included in all communications

### Error Handling Strategy
1. **Non-blocking**: Email failures don't prevent core operations from completing
2. **Logging**: All errors are logged with context for debugging
3. **Fallbacks**: Operations continue even if email service is unavailable
4. **User feedback**: Critical operations show success/failure to users appropriately

## Conclusion

The email notification system enhances the HiPop platform by providing automated, professional communication between markets and vendors. The current implementation provides a solid foundation for future enhancements while maintaining system reliability and user experience.

The modular design allows for easy integration with production email services when ready, while the current debug implementation provides full functionality for development and testing.
