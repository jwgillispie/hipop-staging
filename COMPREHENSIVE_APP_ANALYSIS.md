```javascript
// CURRENT - COMPLETELY INSECURE
match /{document=**} {
  allow read: if true; // ALL DATA PUBLIC
  allow write: if request.auth != null; // ANY USER CAN WRITE ANYWHERE
}
```

**Impact**: 
- All user data (profiles, financial info, business data) publicly readable
- Any authenticated user can modify any data
- Premium subscription data accessible to all users

**Fix Required**: Implement role-based security rules (see detailed rules in full analysis)

#### **2.2 Input Validation - HIGH PRIORITY**
**Issues Found**:
- Basic email validation can be bypassed
- No SQL injection protection
- User inputs not sanitized
- Location data not validated

**Fix Required**: Implement comprehensive validation (see enhanced ValidationUtils)

#### **2.3 Premium Feature Validation - HIGH PRIORITY**
**Issues Found**:
- Client-side only subscription checks (easily bypassed)
- No server-side Stripe verification
- Feature access tokens not validated

**Fix Required**: Server-side subscription verification for all premium features
