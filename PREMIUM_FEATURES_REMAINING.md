## **üîç Technical Notes:**

- **Backend Services**: Most data collection already exists, need frontend UIs
- **Notification Infrastructure**: Need Firebase Cloud Messaging setup
- **Database Schema**: Search history and notification preferences already saving
- **Premium Detection**: Working perfectly with dual-check system
- **Billing Integration**: Stripe subscription flow working correctly

---

## **üí° Quick Wins Available:**
- Dashboard tabs could be populated with existing data (recommendations, search history)
- Settings screens could reuse existing UI patterns from other parts of app
- Search history just needs a simple list view with existing data

**Status**: Core premium subscription flow is complete and working. Remaining work is mostly UI/UX enhancements and notification infrastructure.
